***[Forecast the Sales of a Retail – M5 Competition](https://srujanreddyj.github.io/learnings/2021/01/29/anomaly.html)***  -- [Time-Series, Plotly, Python, LightGBM]
* Forecasted the sales of 30490 products from a large dataset of Walmart Store for 28 — 100 days into the future.
* Developed distinctive features with EDA and developed Insightful Visualizations using Matplotlib and Plotly.
* Experimented with various forecasting models on 9 Hierarchical Time-Series models and was able to forecast sales using the LightGBM model with 60% accuracy.


Detecting Anomalies in Electricity Consumption  [boosting, Time-Series, Plotly, Pandas]
* Developed a Practical Rule-Based Machine Learning Model to Identify Anomalies in electric consumption.
* Using new Extracted Features from the huge data, built a boosting model (XGBoost and Isolation Forest) and predicted consumption values for each day.
* Detected several Anomaly Patterns across the Time-Series Data of 4 Years with an Accuracy of 0.65.


Finding Amenities in a house (Object Detection using Deep Learning) [FlaskAPI, GCP, Python, Linux]
* Developed an end-to-end web application for Detecting 30 Household Amenities using FlaskAPI and GCP.
* Used YOLOv5 model to Detect the Objects on collected Openimages Dataset of 50GB and achieved a mAP@0.5-0.95 of 0.4.
* Improved model Precision to 43% and mAP@0.5-0.95 to 0.5 using Transfer Learning with COCO weights.


***[NETFLIX Data Analysis and Visualization](https://project-visual-1.herokuapp.com/)*** -- [Dashboard, Plotly, Dash]
* Interpreted and Assessed the data to identify key insights and metrics and developed a Dashboard using Python, Plotly, Dash.


Health Insurance Companies’ Risk Exposure– Assess and Categorize [Python, Regression, K-means] 
* Developed a machine learning model device to Assess, Predict and Categorize the Risk of Policyholders of the health insurance industry using Statistical techniques and Bayesian networks.
* Devised a Decision-Making Model for health insurance companies to Assess their Financial Risk Exposure from policyholders.


Image classification and Object Detection [Regression, Random-Forest, PCA, R]
* Implemented machine learning algorithms - Random Forest, Logistic Regression in R to predict image; compared their performance and analyzed the Best Fit Model using Dimensionality Reduction Techniques (PCA).
* Developed a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) using Keras in R for image classification task and achieved an accuracy of 85%.


Investigating Multimodal Density - Sampling Method
* Implemented the Repelling-Attracting Metropolis Algorithm for sampling posterior distribution in searching for unknown sensor locations within a network which produces a multimodal joint posterior distribution.
* Compared RAM with other optimization methods such as BFGS and Metropolis Hastings, in terms of speed and accuracy.
